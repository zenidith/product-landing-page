                </h2>
                <p>You can transform your bike into a neatly folded, easily carried package within a few seconds. Its small size means that it is welcomed on most public transport (even during peak times) and inside buildings for safe storing. Its clever design ensures that mucky parts are kept neatly out of the way. The fold bike can be picked up using the grip on the saddle or towed along effortlessly using the handlebars.

At work, home or out and about due to its compact size the Brompton fold up is welcomed at most places and venues. You won't have the worry of leaving your bike locked up outside and the hassle of replacing a bike.
